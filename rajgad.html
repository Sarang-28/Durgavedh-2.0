            <hr> <p>
                <b>Rajgad Fort</b>, meaning the "<b>King of Forts</b>," is one of the most important forts in Maharashtra and played a crucial role in the history of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>. Situated around <b>60 km from Pune</b> at an elevation of approximately <b>4,250 feet (1,300 meters)</b>, Rajgad served as the <b>capital of the Maratha Empire</b> for nearly <u>26 years</u> before the capital was shifted to <b>Raigad Fort</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Originally known as <b>Murumbdev</b>, the fort was captured by <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> in <u>1647</u> and renamed <b>Rajgad</b>. He spent a significant part of his life here, planning and executing major military campaigns. The fort was an ideal stronghold due to its natural defenses and strategic location, providing a commanding view of the surrounding region.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the most significant events at Rajgad was the birth of <b>Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj</b>, Shivaji’s younger son, in <u>1670</u>. It was also here that <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's first wife, Saibai</b>, passed away. The fort witnessed several key battles, including attacks by the <b>Mughals</b>, but remained a major center of Maratha power.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The architecture of <b>Rajgad Fort</b> is remarkable, with its massive fortifications, water reservoirs, and secret escape routes. The fort is divided into three main sections:
                <b>Padmavati Machi</b> (residential and administrative section), <b>Sanjivani Machi</b> (defensive fortifications), and <b>Suwarndurg Machi</b> (watchtower and stronghold). At the heart of the fort is the <b>Balekilla</b>, the highest point, which offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Shivaji Maharaj shifted his capital to <b>Raigad</b> in <u>1674</u>, Rajgad continued to serve as an important military base. However, in <u>1689</u>, after the death of <b>Sambhaji Maharaj</b>, the Mughals captured the fort. It was later recaptured by the Marathas under the leadership of <b>Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, <b>Rajgad Fort</b> is one of the most popular trekking destinations in Maharashtra. The trek is challenging but rewarding, offering mesmerizing views and a deep sense of history. Adventure enthusiasts and history lovers visit the fort to explore its ruins and relive the glorious past of the Maratha Empire.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The legacy of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> and the fort’s historical significance make <b>Rajgad Fort</b> a must-visit site for those interested in Maratha history and heritage.
