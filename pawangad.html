      <p>
        <strong>Pawangad Fort</strong> is a historically important hill fort located in the
        <strong>Kolhapur district</strong> of Maharashtra.
        It is situated in the Sahyadri mountain range at an altitude of approximately
        <strong>980 meters</strong> above sea level and lies close to the famous Panhala Fort,
        forming an important defensive pair.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pawangad Fort was constructed during the <strong>Adil Shahi period</strong>
        and functioned as a subsidiary fort to Panhala.
        Its primary role was to support Panhala Fort by monitoring enemy movements
        and strengthening the defensive network of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort gained importance during the reign of
        <strong>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong>, when it came under Maratha control.
        Pawangad was used as a military outpost and lookout point,
        helping in the protection of the surrounding areas and trade routes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although smaller in size compared to major forts,
        Pawangad Fort was strategically valuable due to its elevated position
        and proximity to Panhala.
        Together, the two forts created a strong defensive system that made
        enemy advances extremely difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort structure includes remains of
        <strong>stone ramparts, bastions, gateways, water tanks,
        and ruins of old buildings</strong>.
        These features indicate that the fort was capable of housing
        a small garrison and sustaining itself during short sieges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time, Pawangad Fort witnessed changes in control between
        the Marathas and the British.
        With the decline of fort-based warfare, it gradually lost
        its military significance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Pawangad Fort stands in a partially ruined condition
        and is visited by <strong>trekkers, history enthusiasts,
        and nature lovers</strong>.
        The fort offers panoramic views of Panhala, surrounding valleys,
        and the Western Ghats, especially during the monsoon season.
