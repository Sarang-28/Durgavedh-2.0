             <hr> <p>
                <b>Visapur Fort</b> is a majestic hill fort located in the <b>Pune district</b> of Maharashtra, near the famous <b>Lohagad Fort</b>. Perched at an elevation of approximately <b>3,556 feet (1,084 meters)</b>, Visapur Fort is one of the largest and most significant forts in the <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b>. The fort is known for its massive walls, historical importance, and breathtaking views of the surrounding valleys.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort was built by <b>Balaji Vishwanath</b>, the first <b>Peshwa of the Maratha Empire</b>, in the early <u>18th century</u> to strengthen the defense of the <b>Lohagad region</b>. Unlike many other forts captured by <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, Visapur was constructed during the <b>Peshwa rule</b> to provide additional security to Lohagad Fort, which was a strategic Maratha stronghold.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In <u>1818</u>, during the <b>Third Anglo-Maratha War</b>, the fort fell into the hands of the <b>British</b>. Due to its strong defensive position, the British saw Visapur as a major threat and systematically destroyed many of its fortifications to ensure it could not be used against them in the future. The ruins of the demolished structures, including old houses, water cisterns, and remnants of bastions, still stand as a testament to its rich past.

                The fort is known for its <b>enormous walls</b>, which stretch across the plateau, making it one of the widest forts in the region. The structure includes several <b>caves</b>, <b>water reservoirs</b>, and <b>temples</b>, including the famous <b>Hanuman temple</b>, which features multiple carvings of Lord Hanuman. There are also ancient stone archways, which add to the fort's architectural beauty.

                Today, Visapur Fort is a popular trekking destination, often paired with <b>Lohagad Fort</b> due to their close proximity. The trek is <b>moderately difficult</b>, with a mix of steep climbs, slippery paths during monsoons, and dense greenery covering the trail. Trekkers are rewarded with stunning panoramic views of <b>Pawna Lake</b>, <b>Lonavala</b>, and the surrounding mountain ranges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Visapur Fort stands as a symbol of the <b>Maratha and Peshwa legacy</b>, reflecting their architectural brilliance and military foresight. Though partially destroyed, its historical significance and scenic beauty continue to attract history buffs and adventure seekers alike.
