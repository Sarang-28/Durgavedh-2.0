            <hr><p>
                <b>Torna Fort</b>, also known as <b>Prachandgad</b>, is one of the most significant forts in the history of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>. It is located about <b>50 km from Pune</b> and stands at an impressive height of approximately <b>4,603 feet (1,403 meters)</b>, making it the <b>highest fort in Pune district</b>. The fort played a crucial role in the early conquests of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> and became a symbol of Maratha pride and resistance.

                The fort has a rich historical background and is believed to have been constructed in the 13th century during the rule of the <b>Shilahara dynasty</b>. However, it gained prominence when <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> captured it in <u>1646</u> at the young age of <b>16</b>. This was his <b>first major conquest</b>, marking the beginning of the <b>Maratha Swarajya</b>. After taking control of the fort, he expanded its fortifications and renamed it <b>Prachandgad</b>, meaning "massive fort."

                One of the most notable structures within the fort is the <b>Bini Darwaza</b>, the main entrance, along with <b>Kothi Darwaza</b> and <b>Konkan Darwaza</b>. The fort also houses historical remnants like the <b>Mahal</b>, believed to be the residence of the fort’s administrators, and <b>Goddess Mengai Temple</b>, where Shivaji Maharaj is said to have prayed. The fort has multiple water reservoirs and storage facilities, which made it a self-sustaining stronghold.

                In <u>1665</u>, following the <b>Treaty of Purandar</b>, the fort was handed over to the <b>Mughals</b>. However, it was soon recaptured by the Marathas in <u>1670</u> under the leadership of <b>Shivaji Maharaj</b>, reaffirming their dominance in the region. After Shivaji Maharaj’s reign, the fort changed hands multiple times, with the <b>Mughals</b>, <b>Peshwas</b>, and <b>British</b> all controlling it at different points in history.

                Torna Fort is famous for its breathtaking views of the <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b> and is a favorite trekking destination for adventure enthusiasts. The trek to the top is considered <b>challenging</b> due to steep climbs and rough terrain, but it rewards visitors with stunning landscapes and a glimpse into Maratha history.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort stands as a powerful symbol of <b>Maratha bravery</b> and the vision of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, reminding people of his determination to establish an independent kingdom. Today, it is a popular historical and trekking site, attracting history lovers, nature enthusiasts, and adventure seekers alike.
