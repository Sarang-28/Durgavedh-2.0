            <hr><p>
                <b>Lohagad Fort</b>, meaning "<b>Iron Fort</b>," is one of the most well-preserved and historically significant forts in Maharashtra. Located near Lonavala, around 52 km from Pune, this fort sits at an elevation of approximately 1,033 meters (3,389 feet) above sea level. Due to its strategic location overlooking the <b>Pavana River</b>, Lohagad served as an important military stronghold for various rulers over centuries.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort dates back to ancient times and was ruled by several dynasties, including the <b>Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahmani Sultanate, and the Mughals</b>. However, it gained prominence during the reign of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, who captured it in <u>1648</u> and used it as a treasury fort to store loot and valuables.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the expansion of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji Maharaj briefly handed over the fort to the Mughals under the <b>Treaty of Purandar</b> in <u>1665</u>. However, he recaptured it in <u>1670</u>, once again bringing it under Maratha control. The fort later came under the rule of the Peshwas and was used by <b>Nana Phadnavis</b>, a key administrator of the Maratha Empire, to store wealth and valuables.

                One of the most striking features of Lohagad Fort is its <b>massive gates and strong ramparts</b>, which are still intact. The fort has four grand gates—<b>Ganesh Darwaza, Narayan Darwaza, Hanuman Darwaza, and Maha Darwaza</b>—each built to protect against enemy attacks. Another notable structure is the <b>Vinchu Kata</b>, a long, narrow extension of the fort that resembles a scorpion's tail, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding valleys.
            </p>

                Today, <b>Lohagad Fort</b> is a popular trekking destination, especially during the monsoon season, when the entire fort is covered in lush greenery and mist. The trek to the fort is relatively easy, making it accessible for beginners. Along the way, trekkers can explore the nearby <b>Bhaja and Karla Caves</b>, which date back to the 2nd century BCE.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort offers stunning views of the <b>Pavana Lake, Tung Fort, and Visapur Fort</b>, making it a favorite spot for nature lovers and history enthusiasts alike. The legacy of <b>Shivaji Maharaj</b> and the role of <b>Lohagad Fort</b> in Maratha history continue to make it an iconic landmark of Maharashtra.
