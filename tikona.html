            <hr><p>
                <b>Tikona Fort</b>, also known as <b>Vitandgad</b>, is a famous hill fort in Maharashtra, located near <b>Lonavala</b> and <b>Pawna Lake</b>. The fort gets its name from its distinctive <b>triangular shape</b> ("Tikona" means "triangle" in Marathi). Standing at an elevation of approximately <b>3,500 feet (1,071 meters)</b>, Tikona Fort played a crucial role in the defense strategy of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort has a long history, with evidence suggesting it was ruled by <b>the Silhara dynasty</b> in the early medieval period. However, it gained historical importance when it was captured by <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> in <u>1657</u> from the hands of the Adilshahi Sultanate. The fort was used as a watchtower to monitor the surrounding regions and protect the trade routes in the <b>Maval region</b>.

            <p>
                In <u>1665</u>, after the <b>Treaty of Purandar</b> was signed between <b>Shivaji Maharaj</b> and the <b>Mughal general Mirza Raja Jai Singh</b>, Tikona was among the forts that were handed over to the Mughals. However, it was soon recaptured by the Marathas, showcasing their determination and strategic brilliance.

                The fort features several historical structures, including the <b>entrance gates</b>, <b>fortified walls</b>, and <b>caves</b> believed to be used by Buddhist monks in ancient times. A major attraction inside the fort is the <b>Trimbakeshwar Mahadev Temple</b>, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The fort also houses large water tanks and storage facilities that provided essential supplies for the troops stationed there.
            </p>

                Tikona Fort is now a popular trekking destination, attracting adventure seekers due to its moderately challenging climb and breathtaking views of <b>Pawna Lake</b>, <b>Visapur Fort</b>, <b>Lohagad Fort</b>, and the lush green surroundings of the <b>Sahyadri range</b>. The narrow staircases and steep inclines make the trek exciting for thrill-seekers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort stands as a symbol of <b>Maratha courage and resilience</b>, reflecting the strategic brilliance of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> in fort warfare. Today, it remains an important historical landmark and a must-visit destination for history lovers and adventure enthusiasts.
