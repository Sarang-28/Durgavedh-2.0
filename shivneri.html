            <hr> <p>
                <b>Shivneri Fort</b> is one of the most historically significant forts in Maharashtra, as it is the <b>birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, the founder of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>. Located near <b>Junnar</b>, about <b>90 km from Pune</b>, the fort stands at an elevation of approximately <b>3,500 feet (1,067 meters)</b> in the rugged <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b>. Due to its natural defenses and strategic location, Shivneri was considered an ideal fort for military and administrative purposes.
            </p>

                The fort has a long history, dating back to the rule of the <b>Satavahanas</b> and later controlled by the <b>Yadavas of Devagiri</b>. During the <b>Mughal era</b>, Shivneri was an important stronghold. Recognizing its security, <b>Shahaji Bhosale</b>, a general in the <b>Adilshahi Sultanate</b>, chose Shivneri as a safe place for his wife, <b>Jijabai</b>, to give birth to their son. On <u>February 19, 1630</u>, <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> was born here, marking the beginning of a new era in Indian history.

                The fort was well fortified with <b>seven massive gates</b> that served as layers of defense. Some of the most prominent structures inside the fort include the <b>Shivkunj</b>, a memorial dedicated to Shivaji Maharaj, and the <b>water reservoirs like Badami Talav</b>, which ensured a steady water supply to the inhabitants. Another key attraction is the <b>Jijamata Palace</b>, where Shivaji Maharaj spent his early childhood under the guidance of his mother, <b>Jijabai</b>, who instilled in him the values of bravery and leadership.

                Despite its historical importance, <b>Shivneri Fort</b> did not see many battles. The Mughals controlled the fort for most of its later years, and Shivaji Maharaj did not make any significant attempts to capture it, as his focus was on expanding the Maratha Empire elsewhere. Eventually, in <u>1760</u>, the <b>Peshwas</b> took control of the fort.

                Today, <b>Shivneri Fort</b> is a popular tourist destination, especially for those interested in Maratha history. The trek to the top is relatively easy, making it accessible for history enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike. The fort offers stunning views of the surrounding region and serves as a reminder of <b>Shivaji Maharaj’s glorious legacy</b>.
