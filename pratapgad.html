            <hr> <p>
                <b>Pratapgad Fort</b> is one of the most famous forts in Maharashtra, located in the <b>Satara district</b>, about <b>24 km from Mahabaleshwar</b>. Perched at an elevation of approximately <b>3,543 feet (1,080 meters)</b>, this fort is historically significant due to the legendary <b>Battle of Pratapgad</b> fought between <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> and <b>Afzal Khan</b> of the Adilshahi Sultanate in <u>1659</u>. The battle marked a turning point in the rise of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>.

                The fort was built by <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> in <u>1656</u> under the guidance of his prime minister, <b>Moropant Trimbak Pingle</b>. It was constructed to strengthen Maratha control over the <b>Nira and Koyna river valleys</b> and to defend against invaders from the Adilshahi Sultanate. The fort is divided into two sections: the <b>Upper Fort</b>, located on a steep hilltop, and the <b>Lower Fort</b>, which extends along the hill’s southern and eastern slopes.

                The most significant event in the fort’s history is the <b>Battle of Pratapgad</b>, which took place on <u>November 10, 1659</u>. The Adilshahi general <b>Afzal Khan</b> marched towards Pratapgad with a massive army to eliminate Shivaji Maharaj. However, Shivaji Maharaj, using his brilliant strategy, lured Afzal Khan into a private meeting where he used the concealed <b>Bagh Nakh (tiger claws)</b> to kill him in self-defense. Following this, the Marathas decisively defeated the Adilshahi forces, solidifying their dominance in the region.

                Pratapgad Fort features several key attractions, including the famous <b>Mahadev Temple</b>, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the <b>Bhavani Temple</b>, where Shivaji Maharaj is believed to have prayed before the battle. The fort also houses the <b>Afzal Khan’s Tomb</b> and the large <b>statue of Shivaji Maharaj</b>, which was installed in <u>1957</u> by the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra, <b>Yashwantrao Chavan</b>.
            </p>
