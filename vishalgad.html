      <p>
        <strong>Vishalgad Fort</strong>, also historically known as <strong>Khiloray Fort</strong>,
        is an important hill fort located in the <strong>Kolhapur district</strong> of Maharashtra.
        The fort is situated in the Sahyadri mountain range at an altitude of approximately
        <strong>1,120 meters</strong> above sea level and commands a strategic view of the surrounding valleys.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort has ancient origins and was initially constructed during the
        <strong>Bahmani Sultanate</strong> period.
        Due to its elevated position and strong natural defenses,
        Vishalgad served as a key military post controlling routes between
        the <strong>Konkan coast and the Deccan plateau</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vishalgad Fort holds a special place in Maratha history because of its
        association with <strong>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong>.
        In <strong>1660</strong>, after escaping from the siege at Panhala Fort,
        Shivaji Maharaj reached Vishalgad safely.
        This historic event was made possible by the legendary sacrifice of
        <strong>Baji Prabhu Deshpande</strong> at <strong>Pavan Khind</strong>,
        where he held off a large enemy force until Shivaji Maharaj reached Vishalgad.
    </p>

    <p>
        Following this event, Vishalgad became an important base for the Marathas.
        The fort was strengthened and used for military planning,
        troop movements, and protection of the southern regions of the Maratha Empire.
        Its strategic importance increased as it served as a safe refuge during emergencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort complex contains significant architectural remains such as
        <strong>strong stone ramparts, multiple gateways, bastions, water tanks,
        storage rooms, and temples</strong>.
        The presence of adequate water sources allowed the fort to withstand
        prolonged sieges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vishalgad Fort also played a role in later conflicts and witnessed
        changes in control between various powers before eventually coming
        under British rule in the 19th century.
        Despite these changes, the fort retained its military and symbolic importance.
