            <hr> <p>
                <b>Purandar Fort</b> is one of the most significant forts in Maharashtra, located around <b>50 km from Pune</b> in the Sahyadri mountain range. Standing at an elevation of approximately <b>4,472 feet (1,362 meters)</b>, the fort has played a crucial role in the history of the Maratha Empire. It is not only a symbol of <b>Maratha pride</b> but also the <b>birthplace of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</b>, the son of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The history of Purandar Fort dates back to ancient times and was ruled by various dynasties, including the <b>Yadavas, Bahmani Sultanate, and the Adilshahi</b>. However, the fort gained prominence when <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> took control of it in <u>1646</u> at the young age of <b>16</b>. This marked the beginning of his military conquests and the foundation of the <b>Maratha Empire</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In <u>1665</u>, the fort was at the center of an intense battle between the <b>Marathas</b> and the <b>Mughals</b> under the command of <b>Mirza Raja Jai Singh</b>. After a fierce fight, Shivaji Maharaj was forced to sign the <b>Treaty of Purandar</b>, under which he had to surrender <b>23 forts</b>, including Purandar, to the Mughals. However, in <u>1670</u>, Shivaji Maharaj launched a successful campaign to <b>reclaim the fort</b> from Mughal control.
            </p>

                One of the most remarkable features of <b>Purandar Fort</b> is its two levels: the <b>lower fort, called Machi</b>, and the <b>upper fort, known as Balekilla</b>. The Balekilla houses the ruins of old palaces, temples, and military structures. There is also the famous <b>Kedareshwar Temple</b> dedicated to Lord Shiva, which is an important pilgrimage site.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fort also has a significant connection to the <b>Peshwa rulers</b>, as it was the family stronghold of <b>Bajirao I</b>. During the British rule, the fort was used as a <b>prison</b> and a <b>military training center</b>, further adding to its historical importance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, <b>Purandar Fort</b> is a popular trekking destination, offering breathtaking views of the <b>Western Ghats</b>. The fort's rugged terrain, historical monuments, and serene surroundings make it a favorite spot for history lovers and adventure seekers. The trek to the top is moderately challenging, with <b>steep climbs</b> and ancient pathways leading to the historic ruins.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The legacy of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> and the valiant battles fought here make <b>Purandar Fort</b> an unforgettable landmark in Maharashtra’s rich history. It remains a testament to <b>Maratha resilience, bravery, and strategic military brilliance</b>.
