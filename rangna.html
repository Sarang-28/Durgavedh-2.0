        <strong>Rangna Fort</strong>, also known as <strong>Prasidhhagad</strong>, is one of the
        largest, strongest, and most remote hill forts in southern Maharashtra.
        It is located on the border of the <strong>Kolhapur and Sindhudurg districts</strong>,
        deep inside the Sahyadri mountain range, at an altitude of approximately
        <strong>960 meters</strong> above sea level.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort was originally constructed during the <strong>Bahmani Sultanate</strong>
        and later came under the control of the Adil Shahi rulers of Bijapur.
        Due to its difficult terrain, dense forests, and elevated position,
        Rangna Fort was considered almost impregnable and was used as a
        major defensive stronghold.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rangna Fort gained great importance during the reign of
        <strong>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong>.
        It was captured by the Marathas and became a key military base in
        southern Maharashtra.
        The fort was administered by trusted Maratha commanders and
        served as a center for troop movement, storage of weapons,
        and protection of nearby regions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to its strong fortifications, Rangna Fort witnessed several
        attempts of capture by enemy forces, including the Mughals.
        However, its massive stone walls, narrow entrances, steep cliffs,
        and natural forest cover made direct attacks extremely difficult.
        The fort remained under Maratha control for a long period and
        symbolized their defensive strength.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fort complex consists of impressive architectural elements such as
        <strong>multiple gateways, thick ramparts, bastions, watchtowers,
        large water reservoirs, granaries, underground structures,
        and the ancient Rameshwar Temple</strong>.
        These facilities enabled the fort to survive long sieges without
        external supplies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rangna Fort also played an important role in protecting nearby forts
        and villages and maintaining control over the surrounding trade routes.
        Its location allowed continuous surveillance of enemy movements
        across the valleys and hill passes.
