                <b>Kalyangad Fort</b>, also known as <b>Nandgiri Fort</b>, is a historically significant hill fort located in the <b>Satara district</b> of Maharashtra. It is situated at an altitude of approximately <b>3,537 feet (1,078 meters)</b> above sea level and was strategically important in the <b>Maratha Empire</b>. The fort is known for its strong fortifications, deep rock-cut caves, and breathtaking views of the surrounding <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b>.
            </p>

                Kalyangad was originally built by the <b>Shilahara dynasty</b> in the <u>12th century</u>. It later came under the control of the <b>Bahmani Sultanate</b> and subsequently the <b>Adilshahi dynasty</b> of Bijapur. However, in <u>1673</u>, <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> captured the fort as part of his expansion of Swarajya, strengthening its defenses and using it as a strategic outpost to monitor enemy movements in the region.

                After the death of Shivaji Maharaj, the fort was taken over by the <b>Mughals</b> under Emperor Aurangzeb. However, in <u>1707</u>, after the fall of the Mughal Empire, the fort was recaptured by <b>Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj</b>. During the <b>Peshwa era</b>, Kalyangad continued to serve as a key military base and was also used for storing <b>grains, ammunition, and supplies</b>. In <u>1818</u>, after the defeat of the Marathas in the <b>Third Anglo-Maratha War</b>, the fort was taken over by the <b>British</b>.

                One of the most unique features of Kalyangad is its <b>rock-cut caves</b>, believed to have been used by Buddhist monks in ancient times. These caves house a <b>water cistern</b> that remains filled with potable water throughout the year. The fort also has remnants of old structures, including <b>bastions, gateways, and storage rooms</b>.
