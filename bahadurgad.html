    <strong>Bahadurgad Fort</strong> is a historic land fort located in the
    <strong>Ahmednagar district</strong> of Maharashtra.
    It lies near the village of Pedgaon on the banks of the
    <strong>Bhima River</strong> and is also popularly known as
    <strong>Pedgaon Fort</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The fort was constructed in the <strong>16th century</strong> during the
    reign of the <strong>Nizam Shahi dynasty</strong>.
    Due to its location on the plains, Bahadurgad was built as a strong
    military and administrative center rather than a hill fort.
</p>

<p>
    Bahadurgad Fort is noted for its
    <strong>massive stone walls, circular bastions,
    and deep surrounding moat</strong>.
    The fort’s defensive architecture reflects advanced
    Deccan military engineering, designed to withstand artillery attacks.
</p>

<p>
    The fort gained its present name during the Mughal period
    after being renamed in honor of
    <strong>Bahadur Khan</strong>, a Mughal commander.
    Over time, the fort came under the control of the
    <strong>Mughals, Marathas, and the British</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Inside the fort complex, visitors can find remains of
    <strong>palaces, mosques, residential quarters,
    water tanks, and granaries</strong>.
    These structures indicate that the fort once supported
    a sizable military garrison and administrative staff.
</p>

<p>
    Bahadurgad Fort also holds cultural significance,
    as it houses the <strong>temple of Kanifnath Maharaj</strong>,
    which continues to attract devotees from nearby regions.
</p>

<p>
    Today, Bahadurgad Fort stands in a partially ruined condition
    but remains an important historical landmark.
    It is visited by <strong>history enthusiasts,
    architecture students, and local tourists</strong>,
    serving as a reminder of Ahmednagar’s rich historical legacy.
