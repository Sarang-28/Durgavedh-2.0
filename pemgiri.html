    <strong>Pemgiri Fort</strong> is a historic hill fort located in the
    <strong>Ahmednagar district</strong> of Maharashtra.
    It lies in the Sahyadri mountain range near the village of Pemgiri
    and stands at an altitude of approximately
    <strong>1,200 meters</strong> above sea level.
</p>

<p>
    Pemgiri Fort is believed to have been constructed during the
    <strong>medieval period</strong> and was primarily used as a
    watchtower and defensive outpost.
    Its elevated position allowed rulers to keep a close watch
    on the surrounding valleys and trade routes.
</p>

<p>
    The fort gained importance under the rule of the
    <strong>Nizam Shahi dynasty</strong> and later came under
    <strong>Maratha control</strong>.
    Due to its strategic location, Pemgiri Fort played a supporting role
    in the regional defense system of Ahmednagar.
</p>

<p>
    The fort consists of remnants of
    <strong>stone fortification walls, bastions, rock-cut steps,
    and water cisterns</strong>.
    These structures suggest that the fort was capable of sustaining
    a small garrison during times of conflict.
</p>

<p>
    A notable feature of Pemgiri Fort is its
    <strong>steep and narrow trekking route</strong>,
    which made it naturally well-protected against enemy attacks.
    The climb to the fort requires careful navigation,
    making it a moderately challenging trek.
</p>

<p>
    From the summit, visitors can enjoy
    <strong>panoramic views</strong> of the surrounding hills,
    forests, and nearby villages.
    During the monsoon season, the fort is covered in lush greenery,
    enhancing its natural beauty.
</p>

<p>
    Today, Pemgiri Fort stands in a ruined condition
    and is mainly visited by
    <strong>trekkers, history enthusiasts, and nature lovers</strong>.
    Though lesser known compared to major forts,
    Pemgiri remains an important part of Ahmednagar’s
    historical and cultural heritage.
