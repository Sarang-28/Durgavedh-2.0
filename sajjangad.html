            <hr> <p>
                <b>Sajjangad Fort</b>, meaning <b>"Fort of Good People"</b>, is a historically and spiritually significant fort located in the <b>Satara district</b> of Maharashtra. Situated at an altitude of approximately <b>3,350 feet (1,020 meters)</b>, this fort is best known as the final resting place of the revered saint <b>Samarth Ramdas Swami</b>, the spiritual mentor of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>. Unlike other forts in Maharashtra, Sajjangad is more of a spiritual site than a military fortress.
            </p>

                The fort was originally built by the <b>Shilahara dynasty</b> in the <u>12th century</u>. Over the years, it was controlled by the <b>Bahmani Sultanate</b> and later the <b>Adilshahi dynasty</b> of Bijapur. In <u>1673</u>, <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> captured Sajjangad and handed it over to <b>Samarth Ramdas Swami</b> to serve as a spiritual and social reform center. Since then, the fort has been considered a sacred place for followers of <b>Hindu philosophy</b>.

                Unlike other Maratha forts, Sajjangad did not play a major role in military campaigns. Instead, it became a center of <b>spirituality, social service, and education</b>. Samarth Ramdas Swami, a strong proponent of <b>Bhakti (devotion) and Karma (duty)</b>, spent his later years here, guiding Shivaji Maharaj and the people on <b>good governance, self-discipline, and devotion</b>. His teachings continue to influence many people across Maharashtra.

                After the fall of the Maratha Empire, the fort came under British control in <u>1818</u> following the <b>Third Anglo-Maratha War</b>. However, it was never heavily damaged, and its spiritual significance remained intact. Today, the fort is managed by the <b>Shri Ramdas Swami Sansthan</b>, which ensures its maintenance and organizes daily prayers and food offerings (<b>Mahaprasad</b>) for visitors.

                The main attractions at Sajjangad include the <b>Samadhi (final resting place) of Samarth Ramdas Swami</b>, the <b>Ram Temple</b>, and <b>prayer halls</b>. The fort offers panoramic views of the <b>Urmodi Dam</b> and the lush Sahyadri hills. Visitors must climb a series of well-maintained stone steps to reach the fort, making it an accessible yet fulfilling experience.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Sajjangad stands as a beacon of <b>spirituality and service</b>. Devotees and tourists visit throughout the year, especially during <b>Ram Navami</b> and <b>Dasara</b>, to pay homage to Samarth Ramdas Swami and experience the serene, divine atmosphere. The fort remains a symbol of the <b>Maratha legacy</b> and the deep connection between governance and spirituality.
