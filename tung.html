            <hr> <p>
                <b>Tung Fort</b>, also known as <b>Kathingad</b>, is a historically significant hill fort located near <b>Pawna Lake</b> in the <b>Sahyadri mountain range</b> of Maharashtra. Standing at an elevation of approximately <b>3,527 feet (1,075 meters)</b>, the fort is known for its steep and challenging terrain, making it one of the more difficult forts to capture in ancient times. The name <b>"Kathingad"</b> itself means <b>"difficult fort"</b> in Marathi, highlighting its tough and strategic location.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tung Fort was built during the reign of the <b>Adilshahi dynasty</b> and served as a military outpost due to its commanding position over the surrounding region. However, in <u>1657</u>, the fort was captured by <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> as part of his larger campaign against the Adilshahi Sultanate. The fort played a critical role in guarding the nearby trade routes and keeping an eye on enemy movements around <b>Pawna Lake</b>.

                The fort’s structure is relatively small compared to other Maratha forts, but its location made it highly defensive. The main entrance of the fort is designed to be difficult to access, with steep rock-cut steps and a narrow pathway leading to the top. Inside the fort, there are <b>water cisterns</b> that provided drinking water for the stationed troops, along with remnants of old fortifications and temples, including the <b>Ganpati Temple</b> and the <b>Temple of Goddess Tungai</b>, after whom the fort is named.
            </p>

                During the <b>Mughal-Maratha conflicts</b>, Tung Fort, along with other nearby forts like <b>Visapur, Lohagad, and Tikona</b>, played a significant role in defending the Maratha territory. Later, the fort was used by the <b>Peshwas</b> as an observation post due to its strategic height and commanding view of the region.
            </p>

                Today, Tung Fort is a popular trekking destination, offering breathtaking views of <b>Pawna Lake</b>, <b>Mulshi Dam</b>, and the surrounding Sahyadri peaks. The climb is <b>steep and challenging</b>, making it ideal for experienced trekkers. Due to its sharp inclines and narrow paths, the trek requires caution, especially during the monsoon season when the trails become slippery.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tung Fort remains a symbol of <b>Maratha resilience and military strategy</b>. Though it may not be as famous as some of the larger forts in Maharashtra, its challenging trek, stunning views, and rich history make it a must-visit site for history enthusiasts and adventure lovers alike.
