    <strong>Bhuikot Killa</strong>, also known as <strong>Ahmednagar Fort</strong>,
    is a prominent land fort located in the heart of
    <strong>Ahmednagar city</strong> in Maharashtra.
    Unlike hill forts, Bhuikot Killa is built on flat land and is
    surrounded by strong defensive structures.
</p>

<p>
    The fort was constructed in the <strong>15th century</strong> by
    <strong>Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah</strong>, the founder of the Nizam Shahi dynasty.
    It served as the administrative and military headquarters of the
    Ahmednagar Sultanate.
</p>

<p>
    Bhuikot Killa is known for its massive
    <strong>circular fortification walls</strong>,
    deep moat, and strategically designed bastions.
    The fort’s architecture reflects a blend of
    Islamic military engineering and Deccan construction techniques.
</p>

<p>
    The fort holds great historical importance due to its association with
    <strong>Chand Bibi</strong>, the brave queen of Ahmednagar,
    who successfully defended the fort against the Mughal forces
    led by Emperor Akbar in the late 16th century.
    Her leadership and courage are remembered as a symbol of resistance.
</p>

<p>
    During later years, the fort came under the control of the
    <strong>Mughals, Marathas, and the British</strong>.
    Under British rule, Bhuikot Killa was used as a prison,
    most notably to detain leaders of the
    <strong>Indian freedom movement</strong>,
    including Jawaharlal Nehru.
</p>

<p>
    Inside the fort complex, visitors can find remains of
    <strong>palaces, mosques, barracks, wells, and cannons</strong>,
    along with structures that once housed administrative offices
    and royal quarters.
</p>

<p>
    Today, Bhuikot Killa stands as a significant historical monument
    and a protected site.
    It attracts <strong>history enthusiasts, tourists, and students</strong>,
    serving as a reminder of Ahmednagar’s rich political,
    military, and cultural heritage.
